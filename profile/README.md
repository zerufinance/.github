# Zeru Finance

Zeru is building an **AI-powered universal credit layer** for the onchain credit economy, enabling unsecured, behavior-based, under-collateral loans.

## zScore by Zeru

zScore is a **reputation AVS** for crypto x AI apps that helps identify, onboard & reward real contributions to the onchain economy. Reputation is determined by a behavior-centric AI neural network that combines onchain behavior with real-world creds through zkTLS.

**"Crypto has an apps problem, AI has a trust problem. But crypto can provide that trust."**

### The Future of Apps

Businesses will be run by agents. Incumbent apps will use AI agents extensively, or sovereign agents will build their own apps to serve humanity. EigenLayer provides the verifiable cloud infrastructure for a symbiotic future between humans & AI through a suite of Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVS).

### Problem that Zeru Addresses

- Airdrop distributions are inefficient, NFT mints are botted.
- DeFi lending protocols require \~150% of the loan value as collateral, leading to \$18B worth of idle assets.

### Solution: zScore AVS for Onchain Reputation

Zeru has built a behavior-centric neural network to compute reputation scores for wallet addresses as a verifiable service. This allows apps & ecosystems to identify, onboard, and retain real users based on their onchain history, with an option to bring real-world creds onchain through zkTLS.

### Who is zScore for?

1. **Pre-TGE projects** like Monad, MegaETH
2. **Undercollateralized lending platforms** like 3Jane, Kaiju
3. **NFT launchpads** like Magic Eden, Kingdomly
4. **Growth platforms** like Layer3, Galxe
